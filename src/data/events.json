      "description": "DeMar DeRozan, six-time NBA All-Star, has been called a \"basketball savant\" (ESPN) and \"the best closer in the NBA\" (GQ)-but when he went public with his depression, it sparked a conversation that reached far beyond the court. By breaking the stigma of speaking out, he added a new, seldom-heard voice to the mental health dialogue: a successful Black male athlete, openly naming his pain and advocating for others to do the same. Now it's time to tell the full story. Born and raised in Compton, DeRozan was no stranger to hardship-living in poverty, losing friends to gang violence. In worn-out school gyms and community centers, fueled by hunger and a desire to prove himself, he started to rise, but doubts followed. In  Above the Noise: My Story of Chasing Calm , DeRozan opens up about his proudest triumphs and the times he felt so weighed down he couldn't get out of bed. He reflects on what it took to make a name for himself in a new country after getting drafted by the Toronto Raptors, the pressure of playing with veteran athletes as a twenty-year-old rookie, and the pain of losing role models.\n\n\n\n Links \n * Event Page:  https://www.familyactionnetwork.net/events/above-t... \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Register via Zoom:  https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/471725130...",

Dismantling Mass Incarceration: A Handbook for Change  surveys various approaches to confronting the carceral state, exploring bold but practical interventions involving police, prosecutors, public defenders, judges, prisons, and even life after prison. Rather than prescribing solutions, the book offers a forum for discussions-and disagreements-about how to best confront the harms of mass incarceration. The contributors range from noted figures such as Angela Y. Davis, Clint Smith, Ph.D. (FAN '23), Emily Bazelon (FAN '13, '19), and Larry Krasner to local organizers, advocates, scholars, lawyers, and judges, as well as people who have been incarcerated.\n\n\n\n Links \n * Event Page:  https://www.familyactionnetwork.net/events/dismant... \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Register via Zoom:  https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/891725198...",

      "description": "Holding it Together: How Women Became America's Social Safety Net  draws on five years of research in which Calarco, a sociologist and associate professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, surveyed over 4,000 parents and conducted more than 400 hours of interviews with women who bear the brunt of our broken system. Tracing present-day policies back to their roots, Calarco reveals a systematic agreement to dismantle our country's social safety net and persuade citizens to accept precarity while women bear the brunt. She leads us to see women's labor as the reason we've gone so long without the support systems that our peer nations take for granted, and how women's work maintains the illusion that we don't need a net.\n\n Links \n * Event Page:  https://www.familyactionnetwork.net/events/holding... \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Register via Zoom:  https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/101725453...",

From a sinister one-eyed butcher to charming barflies and a special curry restaurant, Anon must navigate an unpredictable, ever-changing landscape to reunite with his family. \"Anon(ymous),\" commissioned by the Children's Theatre Company of Minneapolis and written in 2006 by Japanese-American playwright Naomi Iizuka, reimagines Homer's The Odyssey through the eyes of a modern-day refugee.

THEN we learned that she's a \"Futurist in Residence\" at Stanford's d. school (wondering if they have any job openings?), and THEN we learned that she is obsessed with creating structures for civic thinking and civic engagement. Sign us up!! Great program for election season, and for those of you (all of you!) who would love to have a conversation about civil discourse and the future of democracy that doesn't devolve instantaneously into freeze-dried polarization. Liz Gerber works with Lisa on various projects, and we can't wait to jump in with these two geniuses!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Links \n * Event Page:  https://www.familyactionnetwork.net/events/leaders... \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Register via Zoom:  https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/831727556... \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.d125.org/forward.cfm?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fus02web%2Ezo&destkey=4CD2B83F546A1983A7D166A33A733973F655B233C273AE1F7CC04E180C0613D1",

Such a powerful writer, and an empathetic, giving, charismatic presence. He's devoted his career to young kids and teens, and has won just about every award and honor available. His rep told us that he has memorized the first chapter of the new book, and will be doing a theatrical recitation of it on stage for FAN -- and did we mention we're giving away a boatload of books at the event?? The target audience for the book is high-school aged kids, not elementary or middle school, FYI.

Is his work science fiction, historical fiction, cyberpunk? His most revered books include 1992's  Snow Crash  (which coined the term \"metaverse\" and we all know what that is now, 30 years later) and 1999's  Cryptonomicon . This is a straight-up nerds and geeks program, and for those who know, they will be over the moon to meet their hero.
