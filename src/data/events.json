      "description": "In Over the Influence: Why Social Media is Toxic for Women and Girls - And How We Can Take It Back, communication professor and CNN Opinion contributor Kara Alaimo, Ph.D. reveals how social media is affecting every aspect of the lives of women, girls, and nonbinary people -from our relationships and our parenting to our physical and mental wellbeing. Over the Influence is a book about what it means to live in the world social media has wrought - whether you're constantly connected or have deleted your accounts forever. Alaimo shows why you're likely to get fewer followers if you're a woman. She demonstrates how fake news is crafted to prey on women's vulnerabilities. She reveals why so much of the content we find in our feeds is specifically designed to hold us back. And she explains how social media has made the offline world an uglier place for women. Alaimo offers up brilliant advice for how to get over the influence-how to handle our daughters' use of social media, use dating apps to find who we're looking for, use social networks to bolster our careers, and protect ourselves from sextortionists, catfishers, and trolls. She also explains what we need to demand from lawmakers and tech companies to solve these problems.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Links  * Event Page:  https://www.familyactionnetwork.net/events/over-th... \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n* Register via Zoom:  https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/191708034...",

Communication is a superpower and the best communicators understand that whenever we speak, we're actually participating in one of three conversations: practical (What's this really about?), emotional (How do we feel?), and social (Who are we?). If you don't know what kind of conversation you're having, you're unlikely to connect. Supercommunicators know the importance of recognizing-and then matching-each kind of conversation, and how to hear the complex emotions, subtle negotiations, and deeply held beliefs that color so much of what we say and how we listen. Our experiences, our values, our emotional lives-and how we see ourselves, and others-shape every discussion, from who will pick up the kids to how we want to be treated at work.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Links  * Event Page:  https://www.familyactionnetwork.net/events/superco...",

In her new book, The Menopause Brain, leading neuroscientist and women's brain health specialist Lisa Mosconi, Ph.D. unravels these mysteries by revealing how menopause doesn't just impact the ovaries-it's a hormonal show in which the brain takes center stage. The decline of the hormone estrogen during menopause influences everything from body temperature to mood to memory, potentially paving the way for cognitive decline later in life. To conquer these challenges successfully, Dr. Mosconi brings us the latest approaches-explaining the role of cutting-edge hormone replacement therapies like \"designer estrogens,\" hormonal contraception, and key lifestyle changes encompassing diet, exercise, self-care, and self-talk. Best of all, Dr. Mosconi dispels the myth that menopause signifies an end, demonstrating that it is a transition\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Links  * Register via Zoom:  https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/161710340... \n\n\n* Event Page:  https://www.familyactionnetwork.net/events/the-men...",

      "description": "We live in enormously divisive times. Divisions based on class, politics, race, religion, gender, and nationality are erupting around the globe. The consequences of not having a sense of belonging range from political strife to illness to underperformance at work and in the classroom. Americans have become disconnected from their communities, and about one in five Americans suffers from chronic loneliness, especially young adults. Why is our sense of belonging so undermined? What if there were a set of science-backed techniques for navigating modern social life that could help us overcome our differences, create empathy, and forge lasting connections across divides?\n Links  * Event Page:  https://www.familyactionnetwork.net/events/belongi...",

We are, Lamott says, creatures of love. In each chapter of Somehow, Lamott refracts all the colors of the spectrum. She explores the unexpected love for a partner later in life. The bruised (and bruising) love for a child who disappoints, even frightens. The sustaining love among a group of sinners, for a community in transition, in the wider world. The lessons she underscores are that love enlightens as it educates, comforts as it energizes, sustains as it surprises.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Links  * Event Page:  https://www.familyactionnetwork.net/events/somehow...",
